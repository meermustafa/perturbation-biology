This repo attempts to understand AE vs VAE model efficacy at modeling gene perturbations using simulated Perturb-seq data.

The interactive streamlit aspect to this repo allows users to modulate experimental design (how many cells per sgRNA) and model hyperparameters (beta for VAE) to visualize their impact.
